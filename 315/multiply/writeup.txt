* Compute the total number of dynamic instructions required for your program to compute the product of -2 and 101. 
* Describe how this number changes when you swap the multiplier and the multiplicand.

Instructions required for -2 * 101: 56
Instructions required for 101 * -2: 95

Originally, swapping the multiplier and multiplicand made a huge difference
for our program, since every time our mult function encountered a 1, it was
programmed to branch to an add call, which could take anywhere from 5-10 or
more commands (-2 * 101 was originally 598 commands). However, we figured
that since some numbers, like -2, might involve a lot of addition in this way,
we could optimize the process. For the tradeoff of a few commands in the best
case (101 * -2 was 89 commands, now it is 95), we made the average case run
much faster by making the multiplicand positive before running the rest of
the function. Then it was just a matter of multiplying the result by -1 at
the end, leading to much faster run times.
