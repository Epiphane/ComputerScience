Assignment 1: malloc
Thomas Steinke (tsteinke), CSC453

To compile libmalloc.so and libmalloc.a, run `make` or `make malloc`.
-> libmalloc.so and libmalloc.a will both be created in the current directory

To compile 32- and 64-bit libraries for intel, run `make intel-all`
-> libmalloc.so and libmalloc.a will be created in two directories:
   1) lib/
   2) lib64/

   Each set is 32- and 64-bit, respectively.
